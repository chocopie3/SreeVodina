Virtually Yours — a small interactive birthday vault

What I added
- `index.html` — Entry portal with welcome text, music toggle, confetti and "Enter" button.
- `giftroom.html` — Main gift room with floating clickable gifts (playlist, wallpapers, slideshow, quiz, candle, secret).
- `assets/style.css` — Styles for both pages.
- `assets/script.js` — JS for navigation, audio toggle, modals, and confetti.


Placeholders and customizing
- Audio: You can add your own music from the entry portal using the "Add music" button (select an mp3). The site will play that file locally.
- Playlist links, wallpaper download links, gif/video for memory reel, and the quiz link are placeholders in `assets/script.js`. Edit the switch/case to replace URLs or add embeds.
- Memory Tape: The site uses the images in `images/` (except `profile.jpg`) to create the tape slideshow. Replace/rename files there to customize.

How to try locally (Windows PowerShell)
1. Open the folder in a browser (double-click `index.html`) OR run a simple local server:

   python -m http.server 8000

2. Open http://localhost:8000/SreevatsaVodinas18th/index.html

Next steps you might want me to do
- Replace placeholders with your actual playlist / wallpapers / images.
- Add real download links and host images in the folder.
- Improve visuals, add animations per-gift, and make the secret gift more personal.
